### 🚀 Beginner Developer Journey
I'm just starting my coding adventure! Currently focusing on:

- 🧩 **Solving CodeWars problems** (leveling up my logic skills)

### 🌱 Current Learning Goals
1. Complete [Solidity Beginner Tutorials]  
2. Reach **1kyu** on CodeWars *(current: [5])*  
3. Build my first project (coming soon!)
